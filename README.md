# Heart Disease Health Indicators - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This document outlines an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a large public health data set that contains information about heart disease and other health risk factors, resulting in over 253,000 records. The EDA does not specifically look for statistical cases of significance but will instead look to determine useful information and new knowledge that can be used as part of preventative healthcare measures.

# Goals
The goals for the EDA include looking at health risk factors related to:
Body Mass Index (BMI)
Smoking Status
Blood Pressure
Cholesterol
Mental Health / Physical Health
Diabetes Status
Access to Healthcare
And their relationship with heart disease


# Overview of Dataset
Total Records - 253,680
Target Variable - HeartDiseaseorAttack (0 = No; 1 = Yes)
Features - 22 health and demographic features
Technology/Library
Python (Pandas, Numpy)
Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualization
Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization.


# Trends
People with high blood pressure, diabetes, or smokers were much more likely to have heart disease.
People who had poor general health / had difficulty walking were very likely to show signs of heart disease.
People who checked their cholesterol level regularly / had a BMI in the normal range were more likely to have good health.


# Techniques Used
Descriptive Statistics
Missing Values & Duplicates
Univariate & Multivariate analysis.
Correlation Heatmap and Pairplot.
Crosstabs and Countplots for sub-group discovery.


#Highlights
Cleaned and analyzed data for a very large and high-dimensional health care dataset and created a dataset with no missing values.
Visualized relationships between categorical & continuous health features.
Discussed the meaningfulness of overall importance of heart disease risk features.

# Univariate and Multivariate Analysis

What is the age distribution of the participants?
